## Description

An auto-scrolling breathing screen along with gameplay camera that drifts through a dark smooth dreamscape world that represents calmness and a silence calm night. There is no blob the player but the user still needs to interact with hidden object which is breathing circle and once pressed the camera is the experience. Speed breathes organically using Perlin noise; slowing near hidden symbols, pausing when one is discovered.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- understanding how the Camera2D.js works and is connected to world.js
- edit Camera2D.js to make the screen move such that when the secret object is pressed the camera/screen moves
- didn't update the blobplayer.js 
- 
- make the blob happy and smile with loop
- AI really helped me create the levels I wanted in the blob once hit the right side of screen

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.  I used GenAI to help me edit the code to meet the level requirements, make the blob spikey and making it smiley interactive!

## What I Learned
- How to make a camera self-driven instead of player-driven
- Using Perlin noise to create organic, breathing motion
- Parallax layering to fake depth in a 2D world
- Converting screen space → world space for mouse interaction
- How small technical choices (lerp speed, sway, vignette) carry emotion
