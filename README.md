## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- understanding how the Camera2D.js works and is connected to world.js
- edit Camera2D.js to make the screen move such that when the secret object is pressed the camera/screen moves
- didn't update the blobplayer.js as the camera movement is the whole gameplay experience  
- understand how the calmness components such a slowed breathing circles should connect to the game and help user feel more calm
- how to correctly create a readme file and successfully upload it on github

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments. I used GenAI to help me edit the code to meet the camera movement requirements, make the background such as to evoke a calm silent night background and the hidden objects to make it interactive.
